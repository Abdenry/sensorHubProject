# Sensors For Hub
Ideation, hardware, and research for various sensors to potentially be used for the sensorHub project. 

List of sensor ideas:
- Garage Door Sensor
- Outside sensor hub:
   - Barometer
   - Anemometer (Wind Speed Gauge)
   - Temperature Sensor
   - Humidity Sensor
- Moisture Sensor (for plants)
- Daylight sensor
- PC Sensor
- Smart Door Locks
- Water leak sensors


## Garage Door Sensor
Simple sensor that detects if a garage door is currently open or closed. Detection can be achieved via ultrasonic sensor that relays a true or false if the door is open or closed.

## Outside Sensor hub
A hub that can measure the outside temperature, wind speed, humidty and atmospheric pressure.

## Moisture Sensor
A simple sensor that can be used across multiple pot plants or garden beds to determine if watering is needed.

## Daylight Sensor
A simple sensor used to determine if it is day or not. By itself not particularly useful but can be used in conjuction with other devices to turn appliances on/off.

## PC Sensor
A remote switch for a PC that indicates the current state of the PC (on/off) and can be powered on/off remotely.

## Smart Door Locks
A sensor that detects if doors have been locked after you have left the house (Similar to garage door sensor).

## Water leak sensors
Sensors that detect water leakage in areas that are critical and cannot be wet. This can be used in other sensors or appliances around the house.
